# Security Headers Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security headers implementation for the TradeWebX application. All security headers mentioned in the security audit have been implemented and are actively protecting the application.

## Implemented Security Headers

### 1. Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
**Purpose**: Controls resources the browser is allowed to load, preventing XSS attacks.

**Implementation**: 
- Applied at both Next.js config level and middleware level
- Restricts script sources to trusted domains
- Prevents inline scripts and eval() usage
- Blocks object embedding
- Enforces HTTPS for all connections

**Configuration**:
```javascript
"default-src 'self'",
"script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://cdn.jsdelivr.net https://unpkg.com",
"style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com https://cdn.jsdelivr.net",
"img-src 'self' data: https: blob:",
"font-src 'self' data: https://fonts.gstatic.com",
"connect-src 'self' https: wss:",
"media-src 'self' https:",
"object-src 'none'",
"base-uri 'self'",
"form-action 'self'",
"frame-ancestors 'none'",
"upgrade-insecure-requests"
```

### 2. X-Frame-Options
**Purpose**: Prevents clickjacking by restricting iframe embedding.

**Implementation**: Set to `DENY` to completely prevent embedding in iframes.

### 3. X-Content-Type-Options
**Purpose**: Stops MIME type sniffing vulnerabilities.

**Implementation**: Set to `nosniff` to prevent browsers from guessing content types.

### 4. Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
**Purpose**: Forces HTTPS connections.

**Implementation**: 
- Applied only in production environment
- 1-year max-age with subdomain inclusion and preload
- Automatically redirects HTTP to HTTPS

### 5. Referrer-Policy
**Purpose**: Controls the amount of referrer information sent.

**Implementation**: Set to `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` for optimal privacy.

### 6. Permissions-Policy
**Purpose**: Restricts access to powerful browser features.

**Implementation**: Disables all potentially dangerous browser features including:
- Camera, microphone, geolocation
- Payment APIs, USB access
- Screen capture, fullscreen
- And many other sensitive APIs

## Additional Security Headers

### X-XSS-Protection
**Purpose**: Additional XSS protection (legacy but still useful).

**Implementation**: Set to `1; mode=block` to enable XSS filtering.

### X-DNS-Prefetch-Control
**Purpose**: Controls DNS prefetching.

**Implementation**: Set to `off` to prevent DNS prefetching.

### X-Download-Options
**Purpose**: Prevents automatic file downloads.

**Implementation**: Set to `noopen` to prevent automatic opening of downloaded files.

### X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies
**Purpose**: Controls cross-domain policy files.

**Implementation**: Set to `none` to prevent cross-domain policy files.

## Implementation Layers

### 1. Next.js Configuration (`next.config.ts`)
- Primary security headers configuration
- Applied to all routes automatically
- Environment-specific settings (HSTS only in production)

### 2. Middleware (`src/middleware.ts`)
- Dynamic security headers application
- Request filtering and rate limiting
- HTTPS enforcement
- Suspicious request blocking

### 3. Security Configuration (`src/utils/securityConfig.ts`)
- Centralized security settings
- Environment-specific configurations
- Helper functions for header management

## Environment-Specific Settings

### Development Environment
- HTTPS enforcement disabled
- HSTS headers disabled
- Debug mode enabled
- Localhost and development domains allowed

### Production Environment
- HTTPS enforcement enabled
- HSTS headers enabled with 1-year max-age
- All security headers active
- Strict CSP policies

### Testing Environment
- HTTPS enforcement disabled for test domains
- Security headers active
- Debug mode enabled

## Verification and Testing

### 1. Header Verification
Use browser developer tools or curl to verify headers:
```bash
curl -I https://yourdomain.com
```

### 2. Security Testing
- Test CSP violations in browser console
- Verify iframe embedding is blocked
- Check HTTPS enforcement
- Test XSS protection

### 3. Manual Verification
Use browser developer tools or curl commands to verify headers are working correctly.

## Maintenance and Updates

### 1. Regular Reviews
- Review security headers quarterly
- Update CSP policies as needed
- Monitor for new security threats

### 2. Content Security Policy Updates
When adding new external resources:
1. Update CSP policy in `next.config.ts`
2. Update CSP policy in `securityConfig.ts`
3. Test thoroughly in staging environment
4. Deploy to production

### 3. Security Monitoring
- Monitor CSP violation reports
- Track security header effectiveness
- Update policies based on security trends

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **CSP Violations**: Check browser console for CSP errors and update policies accordingly
2. **External Resource Blocking**: Add trusted domains to CSP policies
3. **Iframe Embedding Issues**: Verify X-Frame-Options is working correctly
4. **HTTPS Redirects**: Check HSTS configuration in production

### Debug Mode
Enable debug mode in development to see detailed security information:
```javascript
DEBUG_MODE: true
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never disable security headers in production**
2. **Regularly update security policies**
3. **Monitor security headers effectiveness**
4. **Test security configurations thoroughly**
5. **Keep security documentation updated**

## Compliance

This implementation addresses the following security requirements:
- ✅ Content-Security-Policy
- ✅ X-Frame-Options
- ✅ X-Content-Type-Options
- ✅ Strict-Transport-Security
- ✅ Referrer-Policy
- ✅ Permissions-Policy

All security headers mentioned in the security audit have been implemented and are actively protecting the application.
